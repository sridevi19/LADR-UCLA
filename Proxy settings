We are connecting to the LADR-HUb via proxy server 

Currently we are using rdv-shrine-proxy-test.lahrc.lahealthresearchcloud.org proxy server

so the routing will be like rdv-shrine-app-test -> rdv-shrine-proxy-test ->ladr-hub

from the proxy server we can able to curl to ladr and from the ladr they need to connect to app server via proxy

from proxy server  try curl to ladr-hub

curl -k http://ladr-hub.ctsi.ucla.edu
curl -k http://ladr-hub.ctsi.ucla.edu/ladr-hub/
curl -k http://ladr-hub.ctsi.ucla.edu/ladr-hub/shrine/rest/happy/version
