Shrine.conf
Supported Data Types


For example:
isQueryable = true
 
setSizeObfuscation = false
 
shrineDatabaseType = "mysql"
 
adapterLockoutAttemptsThreshold = 42

Durations
Durations in older parts of the code are specified as a block containing a single numeric property with a name of either milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, or days.  For example :
maxSignatureAge { days = 5 }
 
maxQueryWaitTime { minutes = 0.5 }
In 1.23 we will convert all of these blocks to a format that matches Scala Durations and allows for default values in Typesafe Config.
maxSignatureAge = "5 days"
 
maxQueryWaitTime = "30 seconds"
 
Endpoints
Endpoints are URLs with parameters, specified as blocks with the following properties:
url (mandatory string): the URL of the endpoint
timeout (optional duration, default is infinity): how long should clients wait for responses from this endpoint before throwing an exception.
For example:
crcEndpoint { url = "http://example.com/i2b2" }
 
crcEndpoint {
  url = "http://example.com/i2b2"
  timeout { minutes = 1 }
}
 
Credentials
Credentials are specified as blocks with the following properties:
domain (optional string): the user's domain, if any
username (mandatory string): the user's username
password (mandatory string): the user's password
For example:
sheriffCredentials {
  username = "sheriffUsername"
  password = "sheriffPassword"
}
 
fooCredentials {
  domain = "shrine"
  username = "foo"
  password = "bar"
}
 
i2b2 Hive Credentials
i2b2 hive credentials for use with a CRC or other i2b2 cell are specified as blocks with the following properties:
domain (mandatory string): the user's i2b2 domain
username (mandatory string): the user's username
password (mandatory string): the user's password
crcProjectId (mandatory string): the user's i2b2 project id for use when logging into the CRC
ontProjectId (mandatory string): the user's i2b2 project id for use when logging into the Ontology cell
For example:
hiveCredentials {
  domain = "HarvardDemo"
  username = "demo"
  password = "demouser"
  crcProjectId = "Demo"
  ontProjectId = "SHRINE"
}
 
Keystore Parameters
Keystore parameters are expressed using a block with the following properties:
file (mandatory string): the name of the keystore file on the classpath
password (mandatory string): the keystore's passwordkeystoreType (String, default is 'JKS'): the type of the keystore.  Allowed values are 'JKS' and 'PKCS12'.
privateKeyAlias (optional string): In the keystore, the alias of the cert with private key component used to identify this node.  The cert with this alias will be used to sign outbound queries.
keyStoreType (optional string): A string describing the format of the keystore. Allowed values are 'JKS' and 'PKCS12'; the default is 'PKCS12'.
caCertAliases (optional array of strings): In the keystore, the aliases, if any certs belonging to certificate authorities this node should trust
For example:
keystore {
  file = "shrine.keystore"
  password = "changethisplease"
  privateKeyAlias = "test-cert"
  keyStoreType = "PKCS12"
  caCertAliases = [shrine-ca, some-other-ca]
}
 
SHRINE Proxy
The SHRINE proxy is configured by a block with a single property, timeout, a duration.  Timeout specifies the amount of time the proxy should wait for a response from the url being proxied.  The default is to wait forever.
For example:
proxy {
  timeout {
    minutes = 5
  }
}
